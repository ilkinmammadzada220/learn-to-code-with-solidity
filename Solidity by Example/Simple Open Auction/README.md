# Simple Open Auction

The general idea of the following simple auction contract is that everyone can send their bids during a bidding period. The bids already include sending money / Ether in order to bind the bidders to their bid. If the highest bid is raised, the previous highest bidder gets their money back. After the end of the bidding period, the contract has to be called manually for the beneficiary to receive their money - contracts cannot activate themselves.
